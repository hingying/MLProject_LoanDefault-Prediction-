# MLProject-Loan Default Prediction


This repository holds a case study on analysis of loan defaulters in Banking and building a machine learning model to classify customers who will default on their loans, which identify risky customers and minimize the losses of the lenders/bank. This Comes with a machine learning model for predicting the probability of loan defaulter with Streamlit, and visualized with Tableau Dashboard. 



## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zaurbegiev/my-dataset?select=credit_train.csv), with 82K customer entries(after cleaning duplicates) labeled as 'Fully Paid' or 'Charged Off' in 'Loan Status'.
